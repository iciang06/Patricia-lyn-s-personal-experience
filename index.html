I'm a kind of person that want to experince and explore everything. But one thing I'm sure about is to travel and explore every country on earth. I want to have a job where a can work and travel at the same time, My biggest passion and my first choice for my future career is to be a pilot or a stewardess. My second choice is to master culinary arts, since my mom is a baker and she expects me to inherit her or continue her business one day in the future. But the thing is, I can't cook... I can only design as a way to express my creativeness. The problem is I'm not financially stable yet. this journey has shaped me into who I am today.

    <h2 class="section-title">The Turning Point</h2>
    <p>For years, I wandered through a sea of dreams and desires, unsure of which direction to take. One day, I wanted to be a ballerina, the next an architect, then a model. My heart tugged in different directions, and the thought of "What course do I really want?" became a constant, lingering question that haunted me. I felt pulled in so many directions, overwhelmed by the endless possibilities but unsure where to start.

        Despite the confusion, one thing became clear over time: I longed to experience the world. I wanted to travel, to see every country, and to feel the freedom that came with exploring new places. The idea of combining my passion for adventure with my career became my compass. The dream of becoming a pilot or stewardess emerged, offering the possibility of living a life of exploration while doing something meaningful.
        
        But there was another path: my mom's bakery. She expected me to take over one day, but my reality was different. I couldn’t cook. My passion lay in creativity, design, and expression, not in baking. Yet, the weight of that expectation lingered, and I felt torn between honoring my mom’s legacy and pursuing my own path.
        
        Then came a realization—a turning point in my journey. I understood that I didn’t have to fit into a mold. I could blend my love for design, my desire to travel, and my creativity in ways I hadn’t considered before. Instead of forcing myself into a career I didn’t feel connected to, I decided to embrace the uncertainty of my path. I could design experiences for others, maybe even in the travel or culinary industries, while still keeping the freedom to explore the world.
        
        This moment of clarity gave me the confidence to step away from the pressure of others’ expectations. I embraced the notion that the path ahead might not be linear, but that didn't mean it wasn’t valuable. Through every struggle and doubt, I discovered the strength to adapt, to take risks, and to trust that the journey itself would reveal the answers in time. My transformation was not in finding one answer, but in learning how to navigate life with resilience, creativity, and the willingness to change.
        
        The pivotal moment of my life came when I faced a significant challenge that tested my strength and will. It was during this time that I realized the importance of perseverance, community, and inner peace. This is a story of self-discovery and determination.</p>
